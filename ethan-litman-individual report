Final Report: Ethan Litman 




1.	Introduction Thousands of vehicles involved rollovers in fatal traffic crashes every year. The rollover is one of the significant safety problems in fatal crashes. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) indicated that 18.9 percent fatal crashes in 2014 (7,592 of 40,164) involved rollovers. Occupants in a rollover crash have greater likelihood of experiencing fatal injuries than occupants in non-rollover crash. Reducing rollovers in traffic crashes will decrease fatalities. The purpose of this project is to predict rollovers in fatal single-passenger-vehicle crashes.
